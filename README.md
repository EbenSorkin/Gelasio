Gelasio by Sorkin Type
===========================

Gelasio is an original typeface which is metrics compatible with Georgia in its Regular, Bold, Italic and Bold Italic weights. Interpolated Medium, Medium Italic, SemiBold and SemiBold Italic have now been added as well.

Gelasio supports Google Fonts Latin Pro glyph set, enabling the typesetting of English, Western, Eastern and Southern European languages as well as Vietnamese and 130+ other languages.

Note: This design will retain the purpose of being metrics compatible with Georgia in Regular and Bold weights while expanding somewhat past what Georgia can do in some areas such as having case sensitive punctuation and a few more number styles. However to remain a fuctional match to Georgia it Gelasio will not include kerning.

Note that the new Georgia found in Windows 10 ( in 2018 ) has some features and glyphs not present in Gelasio such as support for Greek and Cyrillic, Small caps for all three scripts and some additional symbols, currency symbols and box drawing glyphs. Later I hope to make Gelasio fully equivalent.

I also hope to make a new font based on this work with a new name that is
 - not metrics compatible with Georgia
 - has kerning
 - has optical sizes
 - Is tuned to contemporary screen use rather than the relatively low resoution (72 and 96dpi) screens typical of mid-90s.
